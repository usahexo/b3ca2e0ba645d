#  Hoffman Casino has monopoly on the game!

## The Hoffman Casino has a monopoly on the game of Craps. This means that they can set the rules and conditions for how the game is played.

The casino has decided that the minimum bet will be $10 and the maximum bet will be $1,000. This ensures that only high rollers will play the game and increases the house edge.

The casino also decides when players can bet, how many times they can bet, and how much they can win. This allows the casino to control the flow of the game and keep their profits high.

Players at Hoffman Casino can’t even chat with each other while playing because the casino has decided that players are not allowed to communicate with one another. This takes away any chance of collusion between players and reduces the chances of someone winning big.

Hoffman Casino has created a monopoly on Craps and players have no choice but to play by their rules. Bettors looking for a fair and competitive game should avoid this casino.
