#  How do you play the Lovely Lady game?

To play, first you need to get yourself a deck of Lovely Lady cards. You can purchase them online or at some stores, or you can make your own. If you make your own, download the free printable template below.

Once you have your cards, shuffle them and deal 7 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards in the middle of the table, face down. This is your draw pile.

One player starts by flipping over the top card of their deck and placing it in front of them. The player on their left then does the same. If either card is a number card (2-10), the player playing that card takes the set of pictured cards from the table and sets them in front of them. So if they played a six, they would take the six flowers and set them in front of them. If they played an Ace, they would take all of the Aces from the table and set them in front of them. If both players flip over a number card on their turn, whoever played higher takes all of the pictured cards from the table and sets them in front of themselves.

If one or both players flip over a wild card, instead of taking any pictured cards from the table, they set those cards aside and pull two more from their deck to replace them. Play then passes to the next person on the left who flips over their top card and play continues as normal.

The game is won when either player collects all of the pictured cards for their specific flower or when one player has no more cards left in their deck. The winner is then crowned Lovely Lady!
