#  Double deck blackjack comes to Fiji casino

The luxurious Denarau Marina in Fiji is now home to the region’s first ever double deck blackjack table. This new addition is part of the casino’s strategy to lure high-end players to the tables, and it seems to be working – since the launch of the game earlier this week, the casino has seen a surge in betting activity.

Double deck blackjack is a more complex version of the game which offers players more betting options and a greater chance of winning. The table is popular among experienced players, so it’s great that Denarau Marina has added it to their repertoire.

#  New double deck blackjack game in Fiji

In the gambling mecca of Fiji, a new blackjack game is catching on among tourists and locals alike. The game is played with two decks of cards, instead of the traditional one, and offers more excitement and potential wins.

A player’s goal in double deck blackjack is to accumulate as close to 21 points as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points each, aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and other card values are according to their number. If the player’s first two cards total 21 points, it’s called a blackjack and they automatically win the hand (unless the dealer also has blackjack).

The big advantage of playing double deck blackjack is that players have more opportunities to make winning hands. For example, if the first two cards are an ace and a 3, the player can now choose to take another card rather than stand pat (which would be the only option with a single deck game). This means there’s a greater chance of getting closer to 21 points and beating the dealer.

Another advantage of playing double deck blackjack is that there are less high value cards in play, which means the chances of busting (going over 21) are reduced. In a single deck game, there’s always one royal flush card waiting to wreck your chances of winning!

So if you’re looking for a little more excitement in your blackjack games, head on down to Fiji and try out the new double deck version!

#  Double Deck Blackjack Arrives in Fiji 

The new game of double deck blackjack has arrived in Fiji and is now available at the Crown Casino. The casino management decided to introduce this game after receiving numerous requests from avid blackjack players.

The popularity of blackjack stems from the fact that it is a simple game to learn but offers plenty of excitement and opportunities for big wins. Double deck blackjack is even more popular because it offers players even more chances to win, as well as added excitement with the two decks of cards.

In order to play double deck blackjack, players must first place a bet on the table. They are then dealt two cards face up, and their goal is to reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over. If they bust (go over 21), they lose their bet. If they hit 21 exactly, they win an immediate payout of 3:2 on their bet.

If their first two cards are not 21, they have the option of hitting (taking another card) or standing (keeping their current hand). If they hit, they take another card and add its value to their total. If their total goes over 21 after taking a hit, they bust just like if they had gone over with their initial two cards.

If they stand, they keep the two cards they were originally dealt. If the dealer has a total of 16 or under, he must hit; if the dealer has a total of 17 or higher, he must stand. In either case, the player's fate rests with the dealer's next card. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players still in the hand win even money on their bets.

Double deck blackjack is a great game for beginners because there are relatively few rules governing when players can hit or stand. This makes it easier to make winning decisions during play. Experienced blackjack players will also appreciate the increased opportunity for big payouts that comes with doubling down and splitting pairs. So come on down to Fiji's Crown Casino and try your luck at this exciting new version of blackjack!
