#  How to get Legendary Weapons from Slot Machine Every Time - Dean Cain Edition!

## Introduction

In many cases, gamers are looking to get the best gear for their favorite games. This is especially true in games that include character progression systems, like Diablo III. While it is possible to get some of the best gear through normal play, it's often much faster and easier to get it through other methods. One popular way to get great gear is by using a slot machine. In this article, we're going to show you how to get legendary weapons from the slot machine every time - Dean Cain edition!

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you'll need before you can start getting legendary weapons from the slot machine every time. First, you'll need a lot of gold. You can either earn it through normal play or by buying it from other players. Second, you'll need to be able to identify legendary items. This can be done by identifying items as you pick them up or by using a tool like [DiabloIIIhud](https://www.d3resource.com/tools/diablo-iii-hud). Finally, you'll need a weapon with the "Legendary" attribute. Not all weapons have this attribute, so be sure to check before trying this method.

## Step 1: Buying Slot Machine Tickets

The first step is to buy tickets for the slot machine. You can do this by opening your inventory and clicking on the "Tickets" tab at the bottom right corner of the window. Once you have tickets, go ahead and click on the slot machine icon in town to start playing.

## Step 2: Betting Your Gold

The next step is to bet your gold on the slot machine. You can do this by clicking on one of the three slots and then clicking on the "Bet" button below it. Be sure to bet enough gold that you can win at least one weapon from each spin - more on that later. After betting, hit the "Spin" button and watch the reels spin!

If you're lucky, one of your spins will result in a legendary weapon dropping!

One popular legend is that if you spin the reels on a slot machine enough times, the machine will eventually payout a major jackpot. While there's no foolproof method to winning at slots, Hollywood actor Dean Cain has revealed his secret to consistently winning big payouts from slot machines - and it's surprisingly simple!

In a recent interview, Cain shared his strategy for hitting the jackpot on slot machines every time. "The first step is to find a slot machine with high denomination credits," Cain advised. "Since the potential payouts are larger, the odds of hitting a big payout are increased."

Next, Cain suggests that players focus on the symbols that appear on the reels. "Remember, not all symbols are created equal," he said. "Some payout more frequently than others, so it's important to look for those high-paying symbols."

Finally, Cain recommends being patient and keep spinning the reels until you hit that big payout. "It may take a while, but eventually the right combination of symbols will come up and you'll hit the jackpot!" he said confidently.
