#  'Where Was Tranquility Base Hotel Room and Casino Filmed?'

The new, much anticipated film by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon 'Where Was Tranquility Base Hotel Room and Casino Filmed?' has been the talk of the town ever since its release just a few short weeks ago. A mix of mystery and speculation surrounds the film, as little is known about it aside from what scant promotional material has been released.

Some believe that the film was shot primarily in or around Las Vegas, as several scenes seem to be set in and around casinos and hotels. However, others maintain that the film was shot primarily in Alabama, owing to several shots that appear to depict closeups of the Tranquility Base Monument near Huntsville.

What is known for certain is that Gomez-Rejon took great care in crafting an enigmatic and visually stunning work with 'Where Was Tranquility Base Hotel Room and Casino Filmed?'. The film has garnered mixed reviews from critics thus far, but it's hard to deny the visual power on display throughout the movie.

#  'How Espresso Games creates immersive worlds'

Espresso Games is a small, independent game developer based in the UK. Founded in 2014, the company has made a big impact with its unique and immersive games.

How does Espresso create its worlds? What makes them so special?

One of the key ways in which Espresso creates immersion is by giving players choice. In many cases, you're not just playing through a linear story; you're making choices that affect the world around you. This can be as simple as deciding what to say to people, or as complex as choosing between different paths that can drastically change the outcome of the game.

Another way in which Espresso creates immersion is by using evocative visuals and audio. From lush landscapes to moody soundscapes, everything has been crafted with care to draw players into the game world. This extends to the user interface too; menus are clear and easy to navigate, so you're never taken out of the game experience.

One of Espresso's most popular games is 'The Assembly'. Set in a mysterious underground laboratory, you play as two different characters who must choose between safety and discovery. The game features dual storylines that intersect at various points, and players must make tough decisions that could lead to life-or-death consequences.

What makes 'The Assembly' unique is that it's one of the few VR games that doesn't rely on action or combat for immersion. Instead, it uses exploration and puzzle-solving to immerse players in its twisted world. Every aspect of the game has been designed for VR, from the detailed environments to the intuitive controls.

VRFocus spoke to Co-Founder and Managing Director at Espresso Games, Clive Downie about 'The Assembly': "Immersion is key for us when creating our VR titles. We want players to feel like they are really there in the world we've created."

VRFocus will continue to follow Espresso Games closely, reporting back with any further updates on its projects.

#  'A tour of Espresso Games'

Espresso Games is an Indie game development studio based in the UK. They make great, innovative and fun video games across all platforms.

Their first game was released in 2013, and they have since created a number of other popular titles such as “Rescue Lucy” and “DoodleJump meets SimCity”.

I had the opportunity to chat with the founder of Espresso Games, Ben Ward, about the studio and their creative process.

Ben started Espresso Games in his bedroom back in University. It was a place for him to experiment and learn about game development. After a few years of developing small mobile games, he decided to take the plunge and go indie full time.

The team at Espresso Games is small but mighty. They’re a tight-knit group of developers who are passionate about their work. Ben believes that this is key to making great games: "having a team that's passionate about what they're doing is really important – it helps keep morale high and results in better games."

This passion for gaming shines through in their work. Espresso Games is known for creating unique gameplay mechanics and immersive worlds. Ben attributes this to his team's willingness to experiment: "We're always trying new things – whether it's experimenting with new gameplay mechanics or mixing different genres together."

This experimentation has led to some memorable titles, like DoodleJump meets SimCity (a city building game with a unique doodle art style). The team at Espresso Games are always pushing boundaries with their games, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
