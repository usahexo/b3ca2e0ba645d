Pittsburgh, PA – Olympiacos FC is looking to expand their North American presence by adding a new stadium and training facility in the heart of the Strip District. The club has submitted a proposal to the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh for a mixed-use development that would include a 20,000 seat stadium, training facilities, and 150 hotel rooms.

“The relocation of Olympiacos FC to Pittsburgh is an important step in our efforts to increase our brand awareness in the United States and Canada. Our goal is to create a world-class training and competition facility that will be used by our teams as well as local clubs,” said Evangelos Marinakis, President of Olympiacos FC.

Olympiacos FC joins other top European clubs such as Barcelona, Juventus, and Liverpool in establishing a presence in North America. The club currently competes in Greece’s top division, the Superleague, and has won 36 league titles and 22 national cups.

The Rivers Casino development would be located on 11 acres of land adjacent to the casino. If approved, construction would begin in 2019 with a completion date set for 2021.

Pittsburgh’s Strip District is a major destination for locals and tourists alike. With its abundance of restaurants, sports venues, and nightlife, it’s no surprise that people flock to the area. Now, there’s a new way to access the Strip District – Olympiacos of Pittsburgh has announced that they will be using the Rivers Casino in nearby North Strabane as their new way to get to the district.

The move makes sense for a few reasons. The first is that the casino is just minutes from the Strip District, making it an easy option for those looking to get there. The second reason is that the casino offers free parking, something that can be hard to find in downtown Pittsburgh. Finally, the casino also offers shuttle service from various locations in the city, making it easy for people to get there.

For Olympiacos, this move should help them increase their visibility in the city. The team has been working hard to build a fanbase in Pittsburgh, and this could be a major step in accomplishing that goal. In addition, by using the casino as their primary way of getting to the Strip District, Olympiacos will be able to interact with fans and promote their team in a unique way.

Overall, this looks like a great move for both Olympiacos and the Rivers Casino. It should help both entities boost their visibility and popularity in Pittsburgh, which can only be good news for everyone involved.
