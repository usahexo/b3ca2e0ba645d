#  CSKA Moscow Strikes a Blow for Canadian Sports Bettors With New Bank Card

<!--

-->

CSKA Moscow announced a new bank card in partnership with Alfa-Bank that will allow Russian citizens to make sports bets. This is great news for Canadian sports bettors as well, as it increases competition and allows us to take our business elsewhere. CSKA Moscow is the latest in a series of European bookmakers to offer a direct bank card for sports betting, and this move could pressure other bookmakers to follow suit.

The main benefit of using a bank card for sports betting is convenience. You don’t have to worry about finding a trustworthy online bookmaker, setting up an account, or transferring money. You can simply use your bank card to make a deposit and start betting. This also eliminates the need to carry around large amounts of cash, which can be risky.

Another benefit of using a bank card for sports betting is that you can often get better odds than you would with a traditional online bookmaker. This is because the banks are competing for your business, and they want to make it as easy as possible for you to use their services. So if you’re looking for better odds on your favourite sport, then it might be worth considering using a bank card instead of an online bookmaker.

One thing to keep in mind is that not all banks offer the same services when it comes to gambling. So before you sign up for a bank card specifically for gambling, be sure to check with your bank to see what services are available. And if you live in Canada, be sure to check out the new CSKA Moscow debit card which should offer great odds and convenience when it comes to sports betting.
