#  How to Beat Roulette System at Bitcasino: Tips and Tricks 

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The game is simple to play, but it can be difficult to win. Bitcasino offers a number of different roulette games, making it one of the best online casinos for roulette players.

To improve your chances of winning at Bitcasino roulette, follow these tips and tricks:

- Play European Roulette instead of American Roulette. European Roulette has better odds for players than American Roulette.

- Look for a casino that offers 0% house edge on their roulette games. Bitcasino offers several games with a 0% house edge, including American Roulette, French Roulette, and Multi Wheel Roulette.

- Place your bets on the inside of the table. The odds are higher on inside bets than outside bets.

- Avoid betting on black or red. The odds are evens for these two colours, so your chances of winning are 50/50.

- Try betting on specific numbers instead. The odds are higher for specific numbers, but the payouts are also higher.

#  How to Use a Roulette System to Win at Bitcasino 

There are a lot of different casino games you can play online, but roulette is one of the most popular. It’s an exciting game that is easy to learn, but also has enough depth to keep experienced players engaged.

If you want to increase your chances of winning when playing roulette, using a roulette system can help. In this article, we’ll explain how to use a basic roulette system to improve your odds at Bitcasino. 

# Understanding the Roulette Wheel 

The first step in using a roulette system is understanding how the roulette wheel works. The wheel has numbered slots that alternate between red and black. There is also a green slot for 0 and a green slot for 00 (in American roulette). 

When the ball falls into a numbered slot, the bet placed on that number is paid out at odds of 35:1. So if you bet $10 on red and the ball falls into the red slot, you would receive $350 back (plus your original $10 stake). If the ball falls into one of the other coloured slots, your bet is still paid out but at lower odds. 

# The Labouchere System 

The Labouchere system is one of the simplest roulette systems that you can use. As with any other betting system, it isn’t going to make you rich overnight, but it can help you to make better decisions when placing bets at Bitcasino. Here’s how it works: 

- Take a piece of paper and write down a sequence of numbers, for example 1-2-3-4-5. 
- Remove the first and last number from this sequence (1-5), leaving 2-3-4. 
- This is your working sequence. Whenever you lose a bet, add the amount you lost to the end of your working sequence (2-3-4 becomes 2-3-4-5). 
- When you win a bet, subtract the amount won from the beginning of your working sequence (2-3-4 becomes 1-2). 

Here’s an example: imagine you start with a working sequence of 2-3-4 and bet $10 on black. If black wins, subtract 10 from 2-3-4 which becomes 1-2 meaning your new working sequence is 1-. If red then wins, add 10 to 2-. This becomes 3-, so now your new working sequence is 3-. You would then place another $10 bet on black with this new sequence. 

If black loses again, add 10 to 3-, making 4-. If red wins again however, subtract 10 from 4-, making 3-. As long as black keeps losing, each subsequent wager will be for $10 more than the previous one; conversely if red keeps winning then each subsequent wager will be for $10 less than the previous one. At some point black will win and end up with -$10 i (-$110 if betting in dollars), at which point no more betting should take place as we’re now relying on black losing infinitely! 

You can see that by following these simple steps, we are increasing our chances of winning while risking less money each time we lose – which is essentially what any good betting system does! You can use this same system when playing roulette at Bitcasino by simply substituting “black” for any other colour or number.

#  How to Win at Roulette with a Simple System from Bitcasino 

Everyone who has ever played roulette, either online or in a physical casino, has wondered how they can up their chances of winning. After all, the house edge is usually around 2.7%, so over time you will lose money.

However, there are ways to tilt the odds in your favour, and one of the simplest is to use a betting system. In this article we will show you how to use the Martingale System when playing roulette at Bitcasino, and give you a few tips on how to make it work for you.

What is the Martingale System?

The Martingale System is a simple doubling up betting strategy that can be used in any game where you can place bets on multiple outcomes, such as black/red or odd/even. It is based on the principle that you will always win your original bet back plus one more unit if you lose, so long as you keep doubling your bet each time.

For example, if you were using the Martingale System in roulette and wagered €1 on black, and the ball landed on red, you would lose your €1 bet but would then have to wager €2 on black for the next spin. If black then came up again, you would win back your €2 stake plus an extra €1, giving you a total profit of €3. However, if black lost again then your next bet would be €4 (€1+€3), and so on.

How to Use the Martingale System at Bitcasino

Now that we know what the Martingale System is, let's take a look at how to use it when playing roulette at Bitcasino. First of all, make sure that you select 'European Roulette' under the game selection menu; this is the version of the game which allows players to place bets on both red and black (among other options). Then:

- Select your desired chip denomination from the bottom left corner of the screen; we recommend starting off with small bets until you are comfortable with the system.
- Place your chips on any of the recognised betting areas on the table layout; these represent different combinations (e.g. red/black or odd/even) of what could happen when the wheel stops spinning.- Once all bets are placed, hit 'Spin' and watch as the wheel turns!- If your bet wins then congratulations! If it doesn't then don't worry - just follow our tips below on how to adjust your bets and keep yourself in profit.

 Tips for Using the Martingale System Successfully

  So now that we know what the Martingale System is and how to use it when playing roulette at Bitcasino , let's take a look at some tips for making it work for us:   - When doubling your bet always make sure that you have enough funds in your account to cover this amount; if not then stop betting and move onto another game until you have built up more money. - Try not to get carried away with winning streaks; even if black keeps coming up eventually it will result in a loss overall using this system.- Only increase your bets after losing - never increase them after winning.- Always remember that roulette is a game of chance ; no betting system can guarantee 100% success every time.- Finally, be patient! The Martingale System may seem like a slow way to make money but over time it can be extremely successful if used correctly
