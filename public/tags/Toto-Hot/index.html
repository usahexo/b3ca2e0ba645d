In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of playing poker hands and give you a few tips to help improve your game.</p>
<p>Before we get started, it’s important to understand the ranking of poker hands. In order from highest to lowest, here are the rankings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal flush</li>
<li>Straight flush</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Full house</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Three of a kind</li>
<li>Two pair</li>
<li>One pair</li>
<li>High card</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know the rankings, let’s take a look at how to play each hand.</p>
<p>Royal Flush: This is the highest possible hand in poker and consists of a 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, all of the same suit. If you are lucky enough to have a royal flush, bet big and enjoy your victory!<br>Straight Flush: A straight flush is five cards in sequential order, all of the same suit. This is a very strong hand and should be played aggressively.    Four of a Kind: This hand consists of four cards of the same rank paired with another random card. As with most hands, this one should be played aggressively. Full House: A full house is three cards of one rank paired with two cards of another rank. This hand is usually played as a conservative hand. Flush: A flush is five cards all of the same suit ranks below a straight flush). This hand should also be played conservatively unless there are special circumstances (e..g., many opponents still in the hand). Straight: A straight is five cards in sequential order but not all of the same suit). This hand can be played conservatively or aggressively, depending on the situation. Three of a kind: This hand consists of three cards of one rank and two random cards). As with most hands, this one should be played aggressively if possible. Two pair: This hand consists of two different pairs of cards e..g., two Queens and two Kings). Play this hand aggressively if possible but be careful not to lose too much money if someone has a better hand than you do! One pair: This hand consists of two cards of one rank and three random cards). Play this hand as conservatively as possible! High Card: If you don’t have any other good hands, try playing high card as it has the best chance to win!</p>

In this game, players are dealt two cards face down, and then five community cards are placed face up on the table. Players then use these seven cards to make the best possible five-card hand.</p>
<p>The rank of poker hands is based on the probability of being dealt that particular hand. The higher the ranking of the hand, the rarer it is. Here is a list of the 10 winning poker hands, starting with the strongest:</p>
<p>Royal Flush: This is a hand consisting of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten all in the same suit. It is the rarest and strongest possible hand in poker. There is only a one in 649,739 chance of being dealt this hand.</p>
<p>Straight Flush: This is a hand consisting of five consecutive cards all in the same suit. The rank of the straight flush will be determined by the highest card in the hand. There is only a one in 72,192 chance of being dealt this hand.</p>
<p>Four Of A Kind: This is a hand consisting of four cards of the same rank. There is only a one in 4,164 chance of being dealt this hand.</p>
<p>Full House: This is a hand consisting of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. There is only a one in 693 chance of being dealt this hand.</p>
<p>Flush: This is a hand consisting of five cards all in the same suit, but not consecutive. The rank of the flush will be determined by the highest card in the flush. There is only a one in 508 chance of being dealt this hand.</p>
<p>Straight: This is a hand consisting of five consecutive cards not all in the same suit. The rank will be determined by the highest card in the straight. There chances or being dealt this are 1 out if every 31 hands (3%).</p>
<p>Three Of A Kind: This consists off three cards off one rank and two unrelated side cards. The chances are 1 out if every 46 hands (2%) .           Three Card Poker also follows these rankings with One Pair beating high card . If both players have nothing better than than to show their first 2 Cards (no Ace) , then player with higher valued Card at start (Door Card) would win .</p>
<p>  Two Pair : This consists off two different pairs and any fifth card . The chances are 1 out if every 18 hands (5%).</p>
<p>   One Pair : This consists off two cards off one rank and three unrelated side cards . The chances are 1 out if every 7 hands (14%).</p>
<p>As you can see, there are many different types or poker hands that can be played and each has its own set or probabilities associated with it</p>
<h1 id="Understanding-Poker-Hand-Strength-and-When-to-Bet"><a href="#Understanding-Poker-Hand-Strength-and-When-to-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Poker Hand Strength and When to Bet"></a>Understanding Poker Hand Strength and When to Bet</h1><p>In poker, the strength of your hand is important to know in order to make the right decision. The better your hand, the more likely you should be to bet.</p>
<p>There are different levels of hand strengths in poker, which are determined by the rank of each card and the suit. In descending order, here are the five levels of poker hands:</p>
<p>Royal flush<br>Ace high straight flush<br>Four of a kind<br>Full house<br>Flush<br>Straight<br>Three of a kind<br>Two pair<br>Pair<br>High card</p>
<p>Below is an overview of what each hand strength represents and when it’s best to bet. Note that this information is generalized and doesn’t account for any specific game situation.</p>
<p> Royal Flush: The best possible hand in poker, a royal flush is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack, and 10 all of the same suit. This hand is so strong that there’s no need to bet - you should always hope to get this hand when playing!</p>
<p> Ace High Straight Flush: This is the second strongest possible hand in poker. A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. The ace high version is made up of an ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 (of any suit). As with a royal flush, there’s no need to bet with this hand - it’s automatically a winning one.</p>
<p>  Four Of A Kind: A four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. This can be any rank from 2 through 10. When two players have four of a kind, the rank of the card determines who wins - so a four of a kind 8 beats a four of a kind 2. If there are more than two players with this hand, then it becomes a tie and the pot is split equally between all players with this hand.</p>
<p>  Full House: A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, 3 queens and 2 jacks or 4 twos and 2 sixes. Ties are broken by the rank of the three matching cards - so 3 kings and 2 queens beats 3 deuces and 2 jacks.</p>
<p> Flush: A flush is made up five cards all of the same suit but not in consecutive order. So for example 6 diamonds, 7 hearts, 8 spades would make a flush but Ace clubs would not as clubs isn’t in consecutive order). The highest card in the flush determines the ranking - so for example if two players had an 8 diamond flush then the player with the 9 diamond would win as it’s higher than any other card in both flushes.. If there are more than two players with this hand then it becomes a tie and everyone shares equally in the pot.</p>
<p>  Straight: A straight is made up five consecutive cards but not all from the same suit). So for example Ace spades 2 clubs 3 hearts 4 diamonds would be a straight but King clubs would not as clubs isn’t in consecutive order). The highest card in the straight determines who wins - so for example if two players had an Ace heart straight then whoever has the King heart would win as it’s higher than any other card in both straights). If there are more than two players with this hand then it becomes a tie and everyone shares equally in pot..</p>
<p>  Three Of A Kind: A three-of-a-kind consists off three cards all from different ranks (for example 9 hearts 9 spades 9 Clubs) If two people have these then ties are broken by who has Higher ranked Pair(s) .If there more than player has these kinds then its becomes tie .andpot dividied between these Players .</p>
<p>  Two Pair: Two pair consist off two different pairs (For Example 6 hearts 6 Clubs 10 Spades)Ties between Two pairs are Broken by Which Pair has HigherRanked Cards .If more Than one Player has Two Pairs ,then Pots Damner Falls on Highest Ranked Card Outside Of Pairs . So In This Case ,The Jack Of Spades Would defeat The Queen Of Diamonds .If There Are More Than Two Players With This Hand ,Then It Becomes A Tie And Everyone Shares Equally In Pot..</p>

This gives you the chance to make a strong hand, such as two pairs or a full house. Secondly, you should try to keep your hole cards concealed from your opponents as much as possible. If they know what cards you are holding, they will be able to better plan their own moves and strategize against you.</p>
<p>Finally, you should also be aware of the strength of your hand relative to the other players at the table. If you have a strong hand, it might be worth betting more aggressively in order to scare off weaker opponents and maximize your profits. Conversely, if you have a weak hand it might be worth folding early and conserving your chips for another opportunity.</p>
<p>By keeping these tips in mind you can give yourself the best chance of winning when playing poker with your hole cards.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Odds-When-Playing-Poker-Hands"><a href="#How-to-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Odds-When-Playing-Poker-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How to Make the Most of Your Odds When Playing Poker Hands"></a>How to Make the Most of Your Odds When Playing Poker Hands</h1><p>In poker, the odds are everything. If you don’t understand and use the odds to your advantage, you will almost certainly lose more money than you should in the long run. In this article, we will teach you how to make the most of your odds when playing poker hands.</p>
<p>There are a few basic concepts that you need to understand in order to make use of the odds: pot odds, implied odds, and reverse implied odds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pot Odds: *</li>
</ul>
<p>In poker, pot odds are the ratio of the amount of money in the pot to the amount of money it costs to call a bet. This can be expressed in terms of fractions or percentages. For example, if there is $10 in the pot and it costs $2 to call a bet, then the pot odds are 5-to-1 (or 20%).</p>
<p>In order to make use of the pot odds when making a decision about whether or not to call a bet, you need to compare the pot odds with your chances of winning. If your chances of winning are greater than the pot odds, then it is profitable to call (assuming that you also have enough money left in case you do win). If your chances of winning are less than the pot odds, then it is not profitable to call.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implied Odds: *</li>
</ul>
<p>Implied odds are another important consideration when playing poker hands. Implied odds represent your chances of winning additional money after the hand has been played. For example, if you have a flush draw and there is already $50 in the pot, your implied odds would be 50-to-1 (or 2%). This means that for every $50 that you win after hitting your flush draw, you can expect to win an additional $2 in addition to what is already in the pot.</p>
<p>It is important to note that implied odds can be very deceptive. They often depend on how many players remain in the hand and what kind of cards they hold. As a general rule, it is best to only play hands with good implied odds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse Implied Odds: *</li>
</ul>
<p>Reverse implied odds are another way of looking at how much money you can expect to win after hitting a particular hand. Reverse implied odds represent how much money you stand to lose if you don’t hit your hand. For example, if you have a pair of kings and there is already $100 in the pot, your reverse implied odds would be -100-to-1 (or 1%). This means that for every $100 that you lose if you don’t hit your pair of kings, you can expect to win an additional $1 in addition to what is already in the pot.</p>
