      <h1 id="Indiana-Casinos-Could-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-Next-Month"><a href="#Indiana-Casinos-Could-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-Next-Month" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Casinos Could Start Taking Sports Bets Next Month"></a>Indiana Casinos Could Start Taking Sports Bets Next Month</h1><p>Indiana casinos may start taking sports bets as soon as next month. The state’s gaming commission voted 4-1 on Wednesday to approve regulations that would allow sports betting at Indiana’s 13 racinos and casinos.</p>
<p>The new rules still need to be approved by the Indiana legislature, but that is seen as a formality. They would then go into effect on July 1.</p>
<p>Indiana is the 11th state to approve sports betting, following Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut and Maryland.</p>
<p>Casinos in Indiana will offer a variety of bets on professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball and hockey. Betting on other sports such as soccer and golf will also be available.</p>
<p>Indiana Gaming Commission Chairman David Miller said that the new rules are “a good start” but that the commission plans to revisit them after a year to see if any changes need to be made.</p>
<p>“What we’ve done is tried to put in place a very responsible regulatory product,” Miller said. “But it’s not perfect.”</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how much revenue legalized sports betting will generate for Indiana casinos. However, analysts estimate that nationwide it could be worth up to $6 billion per year.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Casinos-Poised-to-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-in-Time-for-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Indiana-Casinos-Poised-to-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-in-Time-for-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Casinos Poised to Start Taking Sports Bets in Time for Super Bowl"></a>Indiana Casinos Poised to Start Taking Sports Bets in Time for Super Bowl</h1><p>Indiana’s nine casinos could start taking sports bets within days of the NFL’s Super Bowl championship game on Feb. 3, state regulators said Thursday. </p>
<p>The Indiana Gaming Commission gave its approval to casino operators wishing to offer sports betting, but with some restrictions. For one, bettors must first go to a casino cage and present identification to place a wager. Second, mobile betting is not allowed. </p>
<p>Casinos also cannot take any action on the Indianapolis Colts in their AFC Championship game Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs. Wagering on college games is prohibited, as is betting on high school games. </p>
<p>In all, there are about 1,500 potential betting scenarios that can be wagered on at the casinos, said Gaming Commission executive director David Wright. He said commission staff will meet with casino operators next week to help them get ready to offer sports betting. </p>
<p>“We’re not starting from scratch,” Wright told The Associated Press. “There are a lot of people who have been doing this illegally for years.” </p>
<p>Casino operators requested the ability to offer sports betting in October after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had barred most states from authorizing sports betting. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia have since started taking bets. </p>
<p>Commission chairman Justin progler said the possibility of legal sports betting has already led to more interest in gambling at Indiana’s casinos. The commission doesn’t have figures on how much revenue may be generated from sports betting, but Wright said it could be “significant.” </p>
<p>“It’ll keep people in our casinos longer,” he said. “It’ll add excitement.”</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Casinos-Could-be-Offering-Sports-Betting-by-the-End-of-the-Week"><a href="#Indiana-Casinos-Could-be-Offering-Sports-Betting-by-the-End-of-the-Week" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Casinos Could be Offering Sports Betting by the End of the Week"></a>Indiana Casinos Could be Offering Sports Betting by the End of the Week</h1><p>The legalization of sports betting in Indiana could be coming to an end this week.</p>
<p>Republican Governor Eric Holcomb is expected to sign a bill into law that will legalize sports betting in the state. The new law would allow casinos in Indiana to offer sports betting, with the first bets being placed later this week.</p>
<p>Governor Holcomb has not made a statement on the issue, but he is expected to sign the bill.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting in Indiana was met with some opposition, but it appears that the bill will pass. Supporters of the bill say that it will bring new revenue to the state, while opponents argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction problems.</p>
<p>Casinos in Indiana are already preparing for sports betting, which is expected to be a major source of revenue for them. The new law would allow casinos to offer both in-person and online sports betting.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently legal in only a handful of states, including Nevada and Delaware. New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice last year.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Casinos-Prepare-for-Sports-Betting-with-Training-Sessions-for-Staff"><a href="#Indiana-Casinos-Prepare-for-Sports-Betting-with-Training-Sessions-for-Staff" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Casinos Prepare for Sports Betting with Training Sessions for Staff"></a>Indiana Casinos Prepare for Sports Betting with Training Sessions for Staff</h1><p>The legalization of sports betting in Indiana is expected to bring in millions of dollars in annual revenue, and casino operators are preparing for the influx of customers by training their staff members on how to handle sports bets.</p>
<p>In March, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting, opening the door for states to legalize the practice. In May, the Indiana legislature approved a bill to allow wagers on professional and amateur sporting events.</p>
<p>Indiana casino operators say they are ready for sports betting and are in the process of training their employees on how it works. “It is going to be new for a lot of people,” said Rusty Wright, vice president of marketing at Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino in Anderson. “But we have been doing some education with our team members so they can be knowledgeable about it and help our guests.”</p>
<p>Casino operators are expecting a surge in business when sports betting becomes legal in July. They say they plan to have plenty of staff available to take bets and answer questions from customers. “We want to make sure that we are prepared for when it does happen,” said Wright. “There is going to be a lot of interest, and we want to make sure that we can accommodate everyone.”</p>
<p>The state’s two largest casino operators, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, both say they are ready for sports betting and have been training their employees on how it works. “We have been gearing up for this since the day the decision came down from the Supreme Court,” said Jason Nice, spokesman for MGM Resorts International in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Both companies say they plan to offer a wide range of betting options, including straight bets, parlays, point spreads, and over&#x2F;under bets. They also plan to offer wagers on major sporting events such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA Final Four.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is expected to generate millions of dollars in annual revenue for Indiana casinos. Operators say they are prepared for the influx of customers and are training their staff members on how to handle bets.</p>

<p>The state legislature is currently deliberating whether or not to legalize sports betting, and a vote could come as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The move would make Indiana the fourth state in the country to allow regulated sports betting after New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>If approved, Indiana casinos would be able to offer betting on NFL, NCAA, NBA, MLB games, among others.</p>
<p>Casinos officials are hopeful that the move will help offset declining gaming revenues. In 2017, casino revenue in Indiana dropped by $133 million.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it would bring in much-needed tax revenue to the state. The bill proposes a tax rate of 9.5 percent on gaming revenues from sports betting. That money would go toward public education and problem gambling programs.</p>
