A mix of mystery and speculation surrounds the film, as little is known about it aside from what scant promotional material has been released.</p>
<p>Some believe that the film was shot primarily in or around Las Vegas, as several scenes seem to be set in and around casinos and hotels. However, others maintain that the film was shot primarily in Alabama, owing to several shots that appear to depict closeups of the Tranquility Base Monument near Huntsville.</p>
<p>What is known for certain is that Gomez-Rejon took great care in crafting an enigmatic and visually stunning work with ‘Where Was Tranquility Base Hotel Room and Casino Filmed?’. The film has garnered mixed reviews from critics thus far, but it’s hard to deny the visual power on display throughout the movie.</p>
<h1 id="‘Espresso-Games-The-Developer-Behind-TBHRC’"><a href="#‘Espresso-Games-The-Developer-Behind-TBHRC’" class="headerlink" title="‘Espresso Games: The Developer Behind TBHRC’"></a>‘Espresso Games: The Developer Behind TBHRC’</h1><p>In a small, unassuming office in the heart of downtown Toronto, Espresso Games is hard at work on their latest project – TBHRC.</p>
<p>Espresso Games is a small, independent developer that has been quietly making a name for themselves in the industry. They are best known for their work on the mobile game Race to 500, which was nominated for Best Canadian Mobile Game at the 2016 Canadian Video Game Awards.</p>

<h1 id="‘How-Espresso-Games-creates-immersive-worlds’"><a href="#‘How-Espresso-Games-creates-immersive-worlds’" class="headerlink" title="‘How Espresso Games creates immersive worlds’"></a>‘How Espresso Games creates immersive worlds’</h1><p>Espresso Games is a small, independent game developer based in the UK. Founded in 2014, the company has made a big impact with its unique and immersive games.</p>
<p>How does Espresso create its worlds? What makes them so special?</p>
<p>One of the key ways in which Espresso creates immersion is by giving players choice. In many cases, you’re not just playing through a linear story; you’re making choices that affect the world around you. This can be as simple as deciding what to say to people, or as complex as choosing between different paths that can drastically change the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>Another way in which Espresso creates immersion is by using evocative visuals and audio. From lush landscapes to moody soundscapes, everything has been crafted with care to draw players into the game world. This extends to the user interface too; menus are clear and easy to navigate, so you’re never taken out of the game experience.</p>
<p>One of Espresso’s most popular games is ‘The Assembly’. Set in a mysterious underground laboratory, you play as two different characters who must choose between safety and discovery. The game features dual storylines that intersect at various points, and players must make tough decisions that could lead to life-or-death consequences.</p>
<p>What makes ‘The Assembly’ unique is that it’s one of the few VR games that doesn’t rely on action or combat for immersion. Instead, it uses exploration and puzzle-solving to immerse players in its twisted world. Every aspect of the game has been designed for VR, from the detailed environments to the intuitive controls.</p>
<p>VRFocus spoke to Co-Founder and Managing Director at Espresso Games, Clive Downie about ‘The Assembly’: “Immersion is key for us when creating our VR titles. We want players to feel like they are really there in the world we’ve created.”</p>
<p>VRFocus will continue to follow Espresso Games closely, reporting back with any further updates on its projects.</p>
<h1 id="‘A-tour-of-Espresso-Games’"><a href="#‘A-tour-of-Espresso-Games’" class="headerlink" title="‘A tour of Espresso Games’"></a>‘A tour of Espresso Games’</h1><p>Espresso Games is an Indie game development studio based in the UK. They make great, innovative and fun video games across all platforms.</p>
<p>Their first game was released in 2013, and they have since created a number of other popular titles such as “Rescue Lucy” and “DoodleJump meets SimCity”.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to chat with the founder of Espresso Games, Ben Ward, about the studio and their creative process.</p>
<p>Ben started Espresso Games in his bedroom back in University. It was a place for him to experiment and learn about game development. After a few years of developing small mobile games, he decided to take the plunge and go indie full time.</p>
<p>The team at Espresso Games is small but mighty. They’re a tight-knit group of developers who are passionate about their work. Ben believes that this is key to making great games: “having a team that’s passionate about what they’re doing is really important – it helps keep morale high and results in better games.”</p>
<p>This passion for gaming shines through in their work. Espresso Games is known for creating unique gameplay mechanics and immersive worlds. Ben attributes this to his team’s willingness to experiment: “We’re always trying new things – whether it’s experimenting with new gameplay mechanics or mixing different genres together.”</p>
<p>This experimentation has led to some memorable titles, like DoodleJump meets SimCity (a city building game with a unique doodle art style). The team at Espresso Games are always pushing boundaries with their games, and I can’t wait to see what they come up with next!</p>

<h1 id="Tip-One-Choose-Your-Bet-Wisely"><a href="#Tip-One-Choose-Your-Bet-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="Tip One: Choose Your Bet Wisely"></a>Tip One: Choose Your Bet Wisely</h1><p>One of the most important things you can do before playing Dragon Koi is to choose your bet wisely. This means taking into account your bankroll and betting limits. You don’t want to risk too much on any one spin, as this could see you quickly out of pocket. However, at the same time you don’t want to wager too little either, as this could lead to you not winning any money at all. A good rule of thumb is to start with a bet that is around 2% of your bankroll – this will give you a chance to win without risking too much if things don’t go your way.</p>
<h1 id="Tip-Two-Use-The-Gamble-Feature-To-Your-Advantage"><a href="#Tip-Two-Use-The-Gamble-Feature-To-Your-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Tip Two: Use The Gamble Feature To Your Advantage"></a>Tip Two: Use The Gamble Feature To Your Advantage</h1><p>The gamble feature in Dragon Koi can be a great way to boost your winnings, but it’s important to use it wisely. Simply guessing the right colour or suit won’t make you a fortune – in fact, it’s likely to lose you money in the long run! Instead, try to use the gamble feature only when you have a decent chance of winning. For example, if you have just landed a winning combination on two of the reels, then using the gamble feature to try and increase your prize could be a good idea. However, if you are just starting out on a new spin and don’t have any winning combinations yet, then it might be best to hold off on gambling until you get something more favourable.</p>
<h1 id="Tip-Three-Check-Out-The-Bonus-Rounds"><a href="#Tip-Three-Check-Out-The-Bonus-Rounds" class="headerlink" title="Tip Three: Check Out The Bonus Rounds"></a>Tip Three: Check Out The Bonus Rounds</h1><p>Dragon Koi has some great bonus rounds that can help boost your winnings significantly. Make sure you take advantage of these by keeping an eye out for them during your gameplay. The best time to aim for these bonus rounds is when you have a high paying symbol lined up on one or more of the reels – this will give you the best chance of scoring big!</p>
<h1 id="Master-These-Tips-And-You-Could-be-a-Slot-Machine-Winner"><a href="#Master-These-Tips-And-You-Could-be-a-Slot-Machine-Winner" class="headerlink" title="Master These Tips And You Could be a Slot Machine Winner!"></a>Master These Tips And You Could be a Slot Machine Winner!</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games, enjoyed for their combination of chance and excitement. While you can’t control the outcome of each spin, if you follow some simple tips you can greatly improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Choose the Right Slot Machine</p>
<p>Not all slot machines are created equal. Some offer better odds than others, so it’s important to do your research before playing. Look for machines that have a high payout percentage – anything over 95% is good – and avoid progressives if you’re looking for a better chance at winning.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Bet the Maximum</p>
<p>Most slot machines have a betting maximum, so be sure to bet the maximum each time to increase your chances of winning the jackpot. If you don’t have the funds to cover the maximum bet, wait until you do before playing.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Watch the Symbols</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning is to watch the symbols on the slot machine as they spin. This will help you determine which symbols are most likely to appear on the next spin. For example, if three 7s have already appeared on the reels, there’s a good chance that another 7 will come up next.</p>
<p>Tip #4: Play with a Strategy</p>
<p>There are several different slot machine strategies that can help boost your chances of winning. One popular strategy is known as “the Martingale system”. With this strategy, you double your bet after every loss in order to recover losses and eventually win back your original bet plus profit. However, use caution when using this or any other strategy, as it can lead to disastrous results if used incorrectly.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Win-At-Dragon-Koi-Game-Slot-Machines-–-Guaranteed"><a href="#How-To-Win-At-Dragon-Koi-Game-Slot-Machines-–-Guaranteed" class="headerlink" title="How To Win At Dragon Koi Game Slot Machines – Guaranteed!"></a>How To Win At Dragon Koi Game Slot Machines – Guaranteed!</h1><p>Dragon Koi slot machines are one of the most popular casino games around. They’re simple to play, but can be lucrative if you know how to win at them. So, read on to find out our top tips for taking home the jackpot on these exciting games!</p>
<p>Firstly, make sure you bet the maximum amount on each spin. This will increase your chances of winning the big prize – as well as increasing the payout if you do happen to win.</p>

You can purchase them online or at some stores, or you can make your own. If you make your own, download the free printable template below.</p>
<p>Once you have your cards, shuffle them and deal 7 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards in the middle of the table, face down. This is your draw pile.</p>
<p>One player starts by flipping over the top card of their deck and placing it in front of them. The player on their left then does the same. If either card is a number card (2-10), the player playing that card takes the set of pictured cards from the table and sets them in front of them. So if they played a six, they would take the six flowers and set them in front of them. If they played an Ace, they would take all of the Aces from the table and set them in front of them. If both players flip over a number card on their turn, whoever played higher takes all of the pictured cards from the table and sets them in front of themselves.</p>
<p>If one or both players flip over a wild card, instead of taking any pictured cards from the table, they set those cards aside and pull two more from their deck to replace them. Play then passes to the next person on the left who flips over their top card and play continues as normal.</p>
<p>The game is won when either player collects all of the pictured cards for their specific flower or when one player has no more cards left in their deck. The winner is then crowned Lovely Lady!</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-the-probability-of-being-dealt-a-specific-hand-in-poker"><a href="#What-is-the-probability-of-being-dealt-a-specific-hand-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="What is the probability of being dealt a specific hand in poker?"></a>What is the probability of being dealt a specific hand in poker?</h1><p>The probability of being dealt a specific hand in poker can be determined by using the mathematics of combinations. For example, the probability of being dealt a royal flush is 1 in 649,739.</p>
<p>To calculate the probability of being dealt a specific hand, first identify all of the unique hands that can be drawn from the deck. There are 52 cards in a deck, and each hand can be composed of any combination of those cards. Then, calculate the number of possible ways that particular hand can be drawn, and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, let’s calculate the probability of being dealt two pairs. There are four different suits in a deck, and each card has two possible values. This means that there are 16 possible two-pair hands that can be drawn from a deck. Dividing 16 by 52 yields a probability of .3096 or 31%.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-probability-of-flopping-a-set-in-Texas-hold-‘em"><a href="#What-is-the-probability-of-flopping-a-set-in-Texas-hold-‘em" class="headerlink" title="What is the probability of flopping a set in Texas hold ‘em?"></a>What is the probability of flopping a set in Texas hold ‘em?</h1><p>In poker, flopping a set refers to the situation where a player has two cards of the same rank and one card is found on the flop. The probability of flopping a set in Texas hold ‘em can be calculated using combinatorics. </p>
<p>There are six different ways to select two out of thirteen cards, and there are ten different ways to select one card from the flop. This means that there are sixty possible sets that can be flopped. Out of these, there are only eighteen situations in which both cards are of the same rank. This means that the probability of flopping a set is 18&#x2F;60, or 30%.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-probability-of-holding-two-pair-on-the-turn-in-Texas-hold-‘em"><a href="#What-is-the-probability-of-holding-two-pair-on-the-turn-in-Texas-hold-‘em" class="headerlink" title="What is the probability of holding two pair on the turn in Texas hold ‘em?"></a>What is the probability of holding two pair on the turn in Texas hold ‘em?</h1><p>The probability of holding two pair on the turn in Texas hold ‘em can be computed using the following equation:</p>
<p>$$P(2pair) &#x3D; \frac{\displaystyle\left(\frac{13}{52}\right)^4}{\displaystyle\left(\frac{13}{52}\right)^{10}}$$</p>
<p>This yields a probability of 0.054%.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-calculate-pot-odds"><a href="#How-do-you-calculate-pot-odds" class="headerlink" title="How do you calculate pot odds?"></a>How do you calculate pot odds?</h1><p>When playing poker, you’ll often be required to make a decision about whether to call or fold given the current pot odds. Pot odds are simply a way of calculating what percentage of the current pot you need to put in to continue playing. This calculation takes into account not only the money currently in the pot, but also the amount of money you stand to lose by folding.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to calculate pot odds, but one of the most straightforward is simply to divide the size of the pot by the size of your bet. So, if there’s $10 in the pot and you’re being asked to call a $2 bet, your pot odds would be 5-to-1 (or 1:5). This means that for every $5 you put in, you’ll win $1 back, plus whatever is left in the pot.</p>
<p>It’s also important to factor in how much money you stand to lose by folding. In our earlier example, if you decided not to call and someone else ended up winning the hand, you’d lose your $2 bet. So, in addition to dividing the size of the pot by your bet, you also need to subtract your potential loss from that number. So, in this case, your true pot odds would be 4-to-1 (or 1:4).</p>
<p>While calculating pot odds can be helpful when making decisions at the poker table, it’s important to remember that they’re never 100% accurate. There are always uncertainties surrounding any given hand, so it’s important to make decisions based on more than just math alone. With that said, though, using pot odds as one piece of information can often help you make better decisions and give yourself a better chance of winning.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-figure-out-your-chances-of-hitting-a-particular-poker-hand"><a href="#How-do-you-figure-out-your-chances-of-hitting-a-particular-poker-hand" class="headerlink" title="How do you figure out your chances of hitting a particular poker hand?"></a>How do you figure out your chances of hitting a particular poker hand?</h1><p>In poker, there are numerous starting hands that players can be dealt. While some hands are obviously better than others, it can be difficult to determine just how likely you are to win a particular hand. In this article, we will take a look at the odds of hitting specific hands and give you a few tips on how to figure out your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Royal Flush</p>
<p>The odds of hitting a royal flush are approximately 649,740 to 1. This means that if you were to play one hand of poker every second, it would take over 68 years for you to hit a royal flush. Obviously, the odds of hitting this hand decrease as the number of cards in the deck decreases, so it is not advisable to bet high on this hand when playing video poker or other games that use a reduced deck size.</p>
<p>Straight Flush</p>
<p>The odds of hitting a straight flush are approximately 4,164 to 1. This means that if you were to play one hand of poker every second, it would take over 24 minutes for you to hit a straight flush. Again, the odds decrease as the number of cards in the deck decreases, so it is not advisable to bet high on this hand when playing video poker or other games that use a reduced deck size.</p>
<p>Four of a Kind</p>
<p>The odds of hitting four of a kind are approximately 72 to 1. This means that if you were to play one hand of poker every second, it would take just over thirteen minutes for you to hit four of a kind. As with royal flushes and straight flushes, the odds decrease as the number of cards in the deck decreases, so it is not advisable to bet high on this hand when playing video poker or other games that use a reduced deck size.</p>

<p>For one thing, Cain has been married twice – first to actress Rebecca Budig from 2001 to 2003, and then to actress Terry Farrell from 2011 to 2013.

Additionally, Cain has never mentioned any children during any of his interviews or public appearances.</p>
<p>Some people have speculated that Cain may have a child with Budig, as she once posted a photo on Instagram that appeared to show a baby footprint. However, she later clarified that the footprint was actually from a pair of slippers she had been given as a gift.</p>
<p>So far, there is no concrete evidence that Dean Cain does indeed have any children. However, until he confirms or denies the reports himself, the mystery remains unsolved.</p>

        <h1 id="What-are-the-8-trends"><a href="#What-are-the-8-trends" class="headerlink" title="What are the 8 trends?"></a>What are the 8 trends?</h1><p>In today’s world, trends seem to change on a dime. With that said, there are a few constants in the ever-changing landscape of popular culture. Here are 8 trends that show no sign of fading away any time soon.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are all examples of streaming services that have taken over the TV market. These platforms allow users to watch whatever they want, whenever they want. This type of service is perfect for those who don’t have time to watch traditional TV shows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social media: Sites like Facebook and Twitter continue to be some of the most popular online destinations. Millions of people use these platforms to stay connected with friends and family, as well as to follow their favorite celebrities and brands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mobile devices: Smartphones and tablets have become an essential part of everyday life for many people. These devices allow users to stay connected with the world around them while on the go.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video gaming: Video games continue to be one of the most popular forms of entertainment. With new consoles hitting the market and games like “Fortnite” becoming global phenomena, it doesn’t look like this trend is going away anytime soon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health and wellness: The health and wellness industry is booming, and it doesn’t look like it will slowing down anytime soon. From yoga to Pilates to veganism, people are increasingly interested in living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conversation starters: Topics like politics and religion can be polarizing, but they continue to be popular conversation starters nonetheless. People are always interested in discussing hot-button issues, even if they don’t always agree with each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Celebrities: While some celebrities fade in popularity over time, others continue to reign supreme. Stars like Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Drake remain massively popular with fans all over the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Memes: Memes are one of the most ubiquitous facets of modern culture. They can be found everywhere from social media sites to traditional news outlets. Whether you love them or hate them, it’s hard to deny that memes aren’t here to stay</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-do-you-know-which-trends-to-follow"><a href="#How-do-you-know-which-trends-to-follow" class="headerlink" title="How do you know which trends to follow?"></a>How do you know which trends to follow?</h1><p>We all have those friends on social media who always seem to be one step ahead of the curve. They’re the ones with the perfect outfits, the latest gadgets, and an inexhaustible knowledge of the latest trends. How do they do it?</p>
<p>It can be tempting to try to keep up with every trend that comes along, but that’s not always possible – or wise. How do you know which trends to follow and which to ignore? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your instincts.</li>
</ol>
<p>If something feels like it’s not quite right for you, then it probably isn’t. Trust your gut instinct when it comes to trends – if something feels like it’s not right for you, there’s a good chance that others will feel the same way.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do your research.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all trends are created equal – some are more wearable or more affordable than others. Do your research before you commit to a trend, and make sure that it’s something that you can actually see yourself wearing or using day-to-day.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stick to what you know.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no need to try out every new trend that comes along – sometimes, it’s best to stick to the things that you know and love. If you feel confident in your personal style, then there’s no need to change just for the sake of changing.</p>
<h1 id="Who-decides-what-is-fashionable"><a href="#Who-decides-what-is-fashionable" class="headerlink" title="Who decides what is fashionable?"></a>Who decides what is fashionable?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question. A variety of factors can contribute, including trendsetters, the media, and consumers themselves.</p>
<p>Some would say that fashion is created by the fashion industry. Designers, magazines, and retailers all play a role in setting trends and dictating what is fashionable. However, it’s not just these entities that decide what’s in – consumers also have a part to play. They dictate what is successful by buying certain items and thereby shaping what the industry produces.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to predict with certainty which items will be popular at any given time, but there are a few indicators that can give some insight into what might be coming next. One of these is social media. Platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are a great way to see what people are talking about and wearing right now. If something starts trending on these sites, it’s likely that it will soon become popular in the mainstream world as well.</p>
<p>Another indicator is runway shows. Designers often showcase their latest collections months before they hit stores, so if you’re keen on keeping up with the latest trends, watching runway shows can be a great way to do so. Keep in mind though that what’s shown on the runway often differs from what ends up being sold in stores – after all, not everyone can afford designer clothing!</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one person or group who decides what is fashionable – it’s a constantly evolving process that is influenced by a variety of factors. So if you want to be ahead of the curve, it pays to stay informed about what’s going on in the world of fashion!</p>
<h1 id="What-if-you-don’t-like-a-trend"><a href="#What-if-you-don’t-like-a-trend" class="headerlink" title="What if you don’t like a trend?"></a>What if you don’t like a trend?</h1><p>There are trends that come and go, and if you’re not a fan, it can be hard to keep up. But what if you don’t like a trend? Do you have to follow it?</p>
<p>For the most part, no. You can certainly choose to not participate in a trend, but there may be consequences. If everyone is wearing something and you don’t join in, you may stick out like a sore thumb. Or if everyone is following a new diet or exercise routine, you may find it difficult to fit in if you don’t do the same.</p>
<p>But there are also times when it’s perfectly acceptable to not like a trend. Maybe the trend is too expensive for you or doesn’t fit your lifestyle. Or maybe you just don’t think it looks good on you. There’s no shame in admitting that you don’t like a trend – in fact, it can even be refreshing!</p>
<p>So if you don’t like a trend, just go with your gut and do what feels best for you. There’s no need to follow the herd if it doesn’t feel right.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-when-a-trend-goes-out-of-fashion"><a href="#What-happens-when-a-trend-goes-out-of-fashion" class="headerlink" title="What happens when a trend goes out of fashion?"></a>What happens when a trend goes out of fashion?</h1><p>There was a time when skinny jeans were all the rage. Celebrities and everyday folk alike donned them as a way to showcase their style and flaunt their curves. But, as trends often do, skinny jeans went out of fashion. And what happened to all of those people who had invested in such a trend?</p>
<p>For many, the switch to looser-fitting pants was an easy adjustment. They simply swapped out their skinnies for a new style that suited their taste and body type better. But for others, giving up their skinny jeans was more difficult. They felt like they had to suddenly abandon their sense of style and start from scratch.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s important to remember that trends come and go. What’s popular today may not be popular tomorrow. So if you find yourself stuck in a trend that’s no longer in fashion, don’t be afraid to let go. It’s OK to experiment with different styles until you find something that makes you feel confident and comfortable in your own skin.</p>
