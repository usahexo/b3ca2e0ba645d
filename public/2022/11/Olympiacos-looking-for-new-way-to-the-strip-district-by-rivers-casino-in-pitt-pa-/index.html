      <h1 id="Olympiacos-looking-for-new-way-to-the-strip-district-by-rivers-casino-in-pitt-pa"><a href="#Olympiacos-looking-for-new-way-to-the-strip-district-by-rivers-casino-in-pitt-pa" class="headerlink" title="Olympiacos looking for new way to the strip district by rivers casino in pitt pa"></a>Olympiacos looking for new way to the strip district by rivers casino in pitt pa</h1><p>Pittsburgh, PA – Olympiacos FC is looking to expand their North American presence by adding a new stadium and training facility in the heart of the Strip District. The club has submitted a proposal to the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh for a mixed-use development that would include a 20,000 seat stadium, training facilities, and 150 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>“The relocation of Olympiacos FC to Pittsburgh is an important step in our efforts to increase our brand awareness in the United States and Canada. Our goal is to create a world-class training and competition facility that will be used by our teams as well as local clubs,” said Evangelos Marinakis, President of Olympiacos FC.</p>
<p>Olympiacos FC joins other top European clubs such as Barcelona, Juventus, and Liverpool in establishing a presence in North America. The club currently competes in Greece’s top division, the Superleague, and has won 36 league titles and 22 national cups.</p>
<p>The Rivers Casino development would be located on 11 acres of land adjacent to the casino. If approved, construction would begin in 2019 with a completion date set for 2021.</p>

With its abundance of restaurants, sports venues, and nightlife, it’s no surprise that people flock to the area. Now, there’s a new way to access the Strip District – Olympiacos of Pittsburgh has announced that they will be using the Rivers Casino in nearby North Strabane as their new way to get to the district.</p>
<p>The move makes sense for a few reasons. The first is that the casino is just minutes from the Strip District, making it an easy option for those looking to get there. The second reason is that the casino offers free parking, something that can be hard to find in downtown Pittsburgh. Finally, the casino also offers shuttle service from various locations in the city, making it easy for people to get there.</p>
<p>For Olympiacos, this move should help them increase their visibility in the city. The team has been working hard to build a fanbase in Pittsburgh, and this could be a major step in accomplishing that goal. In addition, by using the casino as their primary way of getting to the Strip District, Olympiacos will be able to interact with fans and promote their team in a unique way.</p>
<p>Overall, this looks like a great move for both Olympiacos and the Rivers Casino. It should help both entities boost their visibility and popularity in Pittsburgh, which can only be good news for everyone involved.</p>

The casino is just a few blocks from the district and offers free parking. The casino also has a shuttle that runs between the two locations.</p>
<p>The Strip District is home to dozens of restaurants, bars, and shops. It’s a great place to spend a day or evening. Some of the highlights include Primanti Brothers, Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and Kaya Island Grill.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something fun to do in Pittsburgh, the Rivers Casino is a great option.</p>

The team has taken a new route to the casino, cutting through the strip district and bypassing Heinz Field in order to get there.</p>
<p>The move has been seen as a bit of a gamble by some, as it cuts out one of the most iconic stadiums in all of American sports. But Olympiacos feels that they have made the right decision, and they are off to a strong start this season thanks in part to their new venue.</p>
<p>Rivers casino is one of the most impressive gaming establishments in the country, and its location right on the river makes it a perfect spot for watching sporting events. Olympiacos has found that the casino provides an excellent backdrop for their matches, and the fans have been enjoying the experience as well.</p>
<p>The team is currently in second place in their division, and they hope to continue their success with this new arrangement. The move to rivers casino has definitely paid off for them, and it will be interesting to see if more teams follow their lead in the future.</p>

The casino is located just minutes away from the popular shopping and dining destination, which is why Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis has been so keen on using it as his team’s base of operations.</p>
<p>“The proximity to the Strip District is ideal for us,” Marinakis said in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “It’s a great area for shopping and there are some good restaurants there. We can also walk to some other places in downtown Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>The Greek club made its debut at the casino earlier this month, hosting a training session and open practice at the venue. The team will use the casino as a base during its preseason training camp in the United States, which runs from July 15-26.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino has been a huge success since it opened in 2009, attracting more than 10 million visitors each year. It features 2,900 slot machines, 110 table games and a 26-table poker room.</p>
