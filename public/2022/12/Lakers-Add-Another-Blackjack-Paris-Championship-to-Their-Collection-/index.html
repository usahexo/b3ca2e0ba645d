      <h1 id="Lakers-Add-Another-Blackjack-Paris-Championship-to-Their-Collection"><a href="#Lakers-Add-Another-Blackjack-Paris-Championship-to-Their-Collection" class="headerlink" title="Lakers Add Another Blackjack Paris Championship to Their Collection"></a>Lakers Add Another Blackjack Paris Championship to Their Collection</h1><p>The Lakers added another blackjack Paris Championship to their trophy case on Sunday, as they defeated the Celtics in convincing fashion.</p>
<p>LeBron James was once again the star of the show, putting up a triple double and leading the Lakers to victory. This was his second blackjack Paris Championship in a row, and it’s clear that he’s starting to gel well with his new team.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Celtics were missing one of their best players in Kyrie Irving. Nevertheless, the Lakers were still able to win convincingly, which is a testament to their talent and depth.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the Lakers fare against other teams in the playoffs. They have looked very good so far, but there are undoubtedly some teams that can give them a run for their money.</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like the Lakers are going to be a force to be reckoned with this season. LeBron James is still at the top of his game, and the rest of the team is playing well too. This could be another championship year for the Lakers!</p>
<h1 id="Loss-at-Blackjack-Paris-Doesn’t-Derail-Celtics-Playoff-Hopes"><a href="#Loss-at-Blackjack-Paris-Doesn’t-Derail-Celtics-Playoff-Hopes" class="headerlink" title="Loss at Blackjack Paris Doesn’t Derail Celtics Playoff Hopes"></a>Loss at Blackjack Paris Doesn’t Derail Celtics Playoff Hopes</h1><p>The Celtics were dealt a difficult blow on Tuesday night when they lost to the Brooklyn Nets 109-102 in Paris. Kyrie Irving led the Celtics with 31 points but was unable to complete the comeback in the final minutes. The Celtics now have a record of 44-27 and sit in fourth place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the Celtics remain optimistic about their playoff prospects. “We’re still in a good position,” said Gordon Hayward. “We just need to win our last two games and we’ll be in good shape.”</p>
<p>The Celtics will have an opportunity to clinch a playoff spot on Thursday night when they take on the Miami Heat. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 PM at TD Garden.</p>
<h1 id="Raptors-Suffer-Setback-in-Blackjack-Paris-but-Still-Hold-1st-Place-in-the-East"><a href="#Raptors-Suffer-Setback-in-Blackjack-Paris-but-Still-Hold-1st-Place-in-the-East" class="headerlink" title="Raptors Suffer Setback in Blackjack Paris but Still Hold 1st Place in the East"></a>Raptors Suffer Setback in Blackjack Paris but Still Hold 1st Place in the East</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors suffered a setback on their European road trip as they were defeated by the Blackjack Paris team 116-112. This was only the 2nd loss for the Raptors on their 10 game road trip. Despite the loss, they still hold first place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 41-16.</p>
<p>Kawhi Leonard led the Raptors with 27 points and 8 rebounds, while Pascal Siakam added 26 points and 9 rebounds. Serge Ibaka chipped in with 14 points and 11 rebounds. The Raptors were outrebounded 47-35 in the game, which was a big reason why they lost.</p>
<p>The Blackjacks were led by Justin Gray who scored 30 points, including 6 three pointers. He was helped by Nikola Jokic who had 28 points and 13 rebounds. The Blackjacks shot 50% from the field while the Raptors shot only 43%.</p>
<p>The Raptors will now head to London to play against the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night.</p>
<h1 id="Spurs-Continue-Dominance-with-Ninth-Straight-Win-at-Blackjack-Paris"><a href="#Spurs-Continue-Dominance-with-Ninth-Straight-Win-at-Blackjack-Paris" class="headerlink" title="Spurs Continue Dominance with Ninth Straight Win at Blackjack Paris"></a>Spurs Continue Dominance with Ninth Straight Win at Blackjack Paris</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs are on a hot streak, and they are proving it by winning their ninth game in a row at the Blackjack Paris casino. The casino’s sportsbook had the Spurs as 5.5-point favorites, and they easily covered that spread with a 117-92 victory.</p>
<p>This game was never close, as the Spurs led by as many as 39 points. LaMarcus Aldridge led the way for San Antonio with 27 points and nine rebounds. Kawhi Leonard added 20 points and eight rebounds, while Pau Gasol chipped in 16 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>The Spurs have now won 12 of their last 13 games overall and continue to be one of the top teams in the NBA. They will next take on the Golden State Warriors on Sunday afternoon in a matchup of two of the best teams in the league.</p>
<p>San Antonio is currently second in the Western Conference with a record of 36-15, while Golden State is first with a record of 43-8. It should be an interesting matchup, and it is one that San Antonio can win if they continue to play like they have been lately.</p>
<h1 id="Westbrook-Leads-Thunder-to-Decisive-Victory-in-Blackjack-Paris"><a href="#Westbrook-Leads-Thunder-to-Decisive-Victory-in-Blackjack-Paris" class="headerlink" title="Westbrook Leads Thunder to Decisive Victory in Blackjack Paris"></a>Westbrook Leads Thunder to Decisive Victory in Blackjack Paris</h1><p>In one of the most anticipated matchups of the young NBA season, Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder welcomed Jimmy Butler and the Minnesota Timberwolves to Paris. The Thunder got off to a quick start, scoring 36 points in the first quarter. Westbrook was dominant early, scoring 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting in the first 12 minutes.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves were able to keep it close in the early stages of the second quarter, but Oklahoma City’s lead ballooned to 20 by halftime. Westbrook continued his hot streak in the third quarter, scoring 16 points as the Thunder cruised to a 118-100 victory.</p>
<p>Westbrook finished with an impressive stat line: 36 points on 14-of-22 shooting, 8 rebounds, 8 assists, and 2 steals. Paul George added 26 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists for Oklahoma City. Butler led Minnesota with 23 points on 9-of-19 shooting. Karl-Anthony Towns had 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves.</p>
<p>The win improved Oklahoma City’s record to 7-4 on the season. They will next take on the Denver Nuggets in Oklahoma City on Wednesday night. The Timberwolves fall to 7-5 with the loss and will play next against the Orlando Magic in Minnesota on Tuesday night.</p>
