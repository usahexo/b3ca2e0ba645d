      <h1 id="Double-Deck-Blackjack-Hits-Fiji"><a href="#Double-Deck-Blackjack-Hits-Fiji" class="headerlink" title="Double Deck Blackjack Hits Fiji!"></a>Double Deck Blackjack Hits Fiji!</h1><p>The popular card game, double deck blackjack, is coming to Fiji! This is great news for fans of the game, as they will now be able to play it in a casino setting while on vacation.</p>
<p>The new casino, which is set to open in November of this year, will offer a variety of table games, including blackjack, roulette and poker. In addition to the traditional games, there will also be a number of slot machines available for players.</p>
<p>This is certainly good news for the economy of Fiji as well. With the opening of the new casino, tourism is expected to increase, which will bring much-needed revenue to the country.</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the upcoming opening of the casino, a special promotion is being offered. Players who make a deposit of $100 or more will receive a bonus worth 50% of their deposit. This means that players can enjoy doubled chances of winning big at the casino!</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Make your plans today to visit Fiji and enjoy some exciting gambling action at the new double deck blackjack casino!</p>
<h1 id="Double-deck-blackjack-comes-to-Fiji-casino"><a href="#Double-deck-blackjack-comes-to-Fiji-casino" class="headerlink" title="Double deck blackjack comes to Fiji casino"></a>Double deck blackjack comes to Fiji casino</h1><p>The luxurious Denarau Marina in Fiji is now home to the region’s first ever double deck blackjack table. This new addition is part of the casino’s strategy to lure high-end players to the tables, and it seems to be working – since the launch of the game earlier this week, the casino has seen a surge in betting activity.</p>
<p>Double deck blackjack is a more complex version of the game which offers players more betting options and a greater chance of winning. The table is popular among experienced players, so it’s great that Denarau Marina has added it to their repertoire.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting and challenging card game while on holiday in Fiji, be sure to check out the casino’s double deck blackjack table. Who knows, you might just walk away a winner!</p>
<h1 id="New-double-deck-blackjack-game-in-Fiji"><a href="#New-double-deck-blackjack-game-in-Fiji" class="headerlink" title="New double deck blackjack game in Fiji"></a>New double deck blackjack game in Fiji</h1><p>In the gambling mecca of Fiji, a new blackjack game is catching on among tourists and locals alike. The game is played with two decks of cards, instead of the traditional one, and offers more excitement and potential wins.</p>
<p>A player’s goal in double deck blackjack is to accumulate as close to 21 points as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points each, aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and other card values are according to their number. If the player’s first two cards total 21 points, it’s called a blackjack and they automatically win the hand (unless the dealer also has blackjack).</p>
<p>The big advantage of playing double deck blackjack is that players have more opportunities to make winning hands. For example, if the first two cards are an ace and a 3, the player can now choose to take another card rather than stand pat (which would be the only option with a single deck game). This means there’s a greater chance of getting closer to 21 points and beating the dealer.</p>
<p>Another advantage of playing double deck blackjack is that there are less high value cards in play, which means the chances of busting (going over 21) are reduced. In a single deck game, there’s always one royal flush card waiting to wreck your chances of winning!</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a little more excitement in your blackjack games, head on down to Fiji and try out the new double deck version!</p>
<h1 id="Double-Deck-Blackjack-Arrives-in-Fiji"><a href="#Double-Deck-Blackjack-Arrives-in-Fiji" class="headerlink" title="Double Deck Blackjack Arrives in Fiji"></a>Double Deck Blackjack Arrives in Fiji</h1><p>The new game of double deck blackjack has arrived in Fiji and is now available at the Crown Casino. The casino management decided to introduce this game after receiving numerous requests from avid blackjack players.</p>
<p>The popularity of blackjack stems from the fact that it is a simple game to learn but offers plenty of excitement and opportunities for big wins. Double deck blackjack is even more popular because it offers players even more chances to win, as well as added excitement with the two decks of cards.</p>
<p>In order to play double deck blackjack, players must first place a bet on the table. They are then dealt two cards face up, and their goal is to reach 21 or come as close as possible without going over. If they bust (go over 21), they lose their bet. If they hit 21 exactly, they win an immediate payout of 3:2 on their bet.</p>
<p>If their first two cards are not 21, they have the option of hitting (taking another card) or standing (keeping their current hand). If they hit, they take another card and add its value to their total. If their total goes over 21 after taking a hit, they bust just like if they had gone over with their initial two cards.</p>
<p>If they stand, they keep the two cards they were originally dealt. If the dealer has a total of 16 or under, he must hit; if the dealer has a total of 17 or higher, he must stand. In either case, the player’s fate rests with the dealer’s next card. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players still in the hand win even money on their bets.</p>
<p>Double deck blackjack is a great game for beginners because there are relatively few rules governing when players can hit or stand. This makes it easier to make winning decisions during play. Experienced blackjack players will also appreciate the increased opportunity for big payouts that comes with doubling down and splitting pairs. So come on down to Fiji’s Crown Casino and try your luck at this exciting new version of blackjack!</p>
<h1 id="Double-deck-blackjack-comes-to-town-in-Fiji"><a href="#Double-deck-blackjack-comes-to-town-in-Fiji" class="headerlink" title="Double deck blackjack comes to town in Fiji"></a>Double deck blackjack comes to town in Fiji</h1><p>Gambling has always been a popular pastime in Fiji, and with the recent introduction of double deck blackjack, it looks like that is only going to continue.</p>
<p>The game is being played at the Shangri-La Resort in Denarau and is already proving a big hit with players. The rules are pretty simple – each player is dealt two cards face up, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
<p>As well as the chance to win big payouts, one of the things that makes double deck blackjack so popular is that it’s one of the easiest games to learn how to play. Players can quickly pick up the basics and start enjoying themselves right away.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting new way to enjoy your time in Fiji, be sure to check out double deck blackjack at Shangri-La Resort – you won’t be disappointed!</p>
