      <h1 id="What-are-the-8-trends"><a href="#What-are-the-8-trends" class="headerlink" title="What are the 8 trends?"></a>What are the 8 trends?</h1><p>In today’s world, trends seem to change on a dime. With that said, there are a few constants in the ever-changing landscape of popular culture. Here are 8 trends that show no sign of fading away any time soon.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are all examples of streaming services that have taken over the TV market. These platforms allow users to watch whatever they want, whenever they want. This type of service is perfect for those who don’t have time to watch traditional TV shows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social media: Sites like Facebook and Twitter continue to be some of the most popular online destinations. Millions of people use these platforms to stay connected with friends and family, as well as to follow their favorite celebrities and brands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mobile devices: Smartphones and tablets have become an essential part of everyday life for many people. These devices allow users to stay connected with the world around them while on the go.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video gaming: Video games continue to be one of the most popular forms of entertainment. With new consoles hitting the market and games like “Fortnite” becoming global phenomena, it doesn’t look like this trend is going away anytime soon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health and wellness: The health and wellness industry is booming, and it doesn’t look like it will slowing down anytime soon. From yoga to Pilates to veganism, people are increasingly interested in living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conversation starters: Topics like politics and religion can be polarizing, but they continue to be popular conversation starters nonetheless. People are always interested in discussing hot-button issues, even if they don’t always agree with each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Celebrities: While some celebrities fade in popularity over time, others continue to reign supreme. Stars like Rihanna, Beyoncé, and Drake remain massively popular with fans all over the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Memes: Memes are one of the most ubiquitous facets of modern culture. They can be found everywhere from social media sites to traditional news outlets. Whether you love them or hate them, it’s hard to deny that memes aren’t here to stay</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-do-you-know-which-trends-to-follow"><a href="#How-do-you-know-which-trends-to-follow" class="headerlink" title="How do you know which trends to follow?"></a>How do you know which trends to follow?</h1><p>We all have those friends on social media who always seem to be one step ahead of the curve. They’re the ones with the perfect outfits, the latest gadgets, and an inexhaustible knowledge of the latest trends. How do they do it?</p>
<p>It can be tempting to try to keep up with every trend that comes along, but that’s not always possible – or wise. How do you know which trends to follow and which to ignore? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your instincts.</li>
</ol>
<p>If something feels like it’s not quite right for you, then it probably isn’t. Trust your gut instinct when it comes to trends – if something feels like it’s not right for you, there’s a good chance that others will feel the same way.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do your research.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all trends are created equal – some are more wearable or more affordable than others. Do your research before you commit to a trend, and make sure that it’s something that you can actually see yourself wearing or using day-to-day.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stick to what you know.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no need to try out every new trend that comes along – sometimes, it’s best to stick to the things that you know and love. If you feel confident in your personal style, then there’s no need to change just for the sake of changing.</p>
<h1 id="Who-decides-what-is-fashionable"><a href="#Who-decides-what-is-fashionable" class="headerlink" title="Who decides what is fashionable?"></a>Who decides what is fashionable?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question. A variety of factors can contribute, including trendsetters, the media, and consumers themselves.</p>
<p>Some would say that fashion is created by the fashion industry. Designers, magazines, and retailers all play a role in setting trends and dictating what is fashionable. However, it’s not just these entities that decide what’s in – consumers also have a part to play. They dictate what is successful by buying certain items and thereby shaping what the industry produces.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to predict with certainty which items will be popular at any given time, but there are a few indicators that can give some insight into what might be coming next. One of these is social media. Platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are a great way to see what people are talking about and wearing right now. If something starts trending on these sites, it’s likely that it will soon become popular in the mainstream world as well.</p>
<p>Another indicator is runway shows. Designers often showcase their latest collections months before they hit stores, so if you’re keen on keeping up with the latest trends, watching runway shows can be a great way to do so. Keep in mind though that what’s shown on the runway often differs from what ends up being sold in stores – after all, not everyone can afford designer clothing!</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one person or group who decides what is fashionable – it’s a constantly evolving process that is influenced by a variety of factors. So if you want to be ahead of the curve, it pays to stay informed about what’s going on in the world of fashion!</p>
<h1 id="What-if-you-don’t-like-a-trend"><a href="#What-if-you-don’t-like-a-trend" class="headerlink" title="What if you don’t like a trend?"></a>What if you don’t like a trend?</h1><p>There are trends that come and go, and if you’re not a fan, it can be hard to keep up. But what if you don’t like a trend? Do you have to follow it?</p>
<p>For the most part, no. You can certainly choose to not participate in a trend, but there may be consequences. If everyone is wearing something and you don’t join in, you may stick out like a sore thumb. Or if everyone is following a new diet or exercise routine, you may find it difficult to fit in if you don’t do the same.</p>
<p>But there are also times when it’s perfectly acceptable to not like a trend. Maybe the trend is too expensive for you or doesn’t fit your lifestyle. Or maybe you just don’t think it looks good on you. There’s no shame in admitting that you don’t like a trend – in fact, it can even be refreshing!</p>
<p>So if you don’t like a trend, just go with your gut and do what feels best for you. There’s no need to follow the herd if it doesn’t feel right.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-when-a-trend-goes-out-of-fashion"><a href="#What-happens-when-a-trend-goes-out-of-fashion" class="headerlink" title="What happens when a trend goes out of fashion?"></a>What happens when a trend goes out of fashion?</h1><p>There was a time when skinny jeans were all the rage. Celebrities and everyday folk alike donned them as a way to showcase their style and flaunt their curves. But, as trends often do, skinny jeans went out of fashion. And what happened to all of those people who had invested in such a trend?</p>
<p>For many, the switch to looser-fitting pants was an easy adjustment. They simply swapped out their skinnies for a new style that suited their taste and body type better. But for others, giving up their skinny jeans was more difficult. They felt like they had to suddenly abandon their sense of style and start from scratch.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s important to remember that trends come and go. What’s popular today may not be popular tomorrow. So if you find yourself stuck in a trend that’s no longer in fashion, don’t be afraid to let go. It’s OK to experiment with different styles until you find something that makes you feel confident and comfortable in your own skin.</p>
